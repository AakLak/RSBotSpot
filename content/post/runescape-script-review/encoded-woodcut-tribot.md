If your desired tree and location aren't available as a preset, you can use the 'Custom' tab to easily set them up.

#### Custom Location

We found little to nothing to complain about regarding Encoded Woodcutter. Users have botted with it successfully for suicide farms and 99s alike.

It's simple GUI, ability to chop at any location, and extra settings for drop and antiban makes for a well rounded script. Encoded is very active, and does a great job at handling any issues quickly. The fact that it's free makes it all that much better!
