## Using Fluffee Tutorial Island & Account Creator v3

</div>

### 2. Set your Account Preferences
The script works with either premade Runescape accounts, or can create them for you. I'll cover on how to use both methods heres.

#### Premade Accounts
Start by selecting your target tree type, location, and dropping style in the 'Preset' tab.

If your desired tree and location aren't available as a preset, you can use the 'Custom' tab to easily set them up.

#### Custom Location
Start by selecting the 'Custom' tab, and your tree & drop method of choice. Then simply right click your target trees on Runescape to select them.

### 3. Additional Settings
The last 'Settings' tab contains options for:

* Antiban Options: Reaction Times / Timed Actions
* Picking up nests
* Shift Drop Pattern: Top to bottom or Left to right
* Stopping at: Desired level or Time played

After that you can hit start, and hit back!

We found little to nothing to complain about regarding Encoded Woodcutter. Users have botted with it successfully for suicide farms and 99s alike.

It's simple GUI, ability to chop at any location, and extra settings for drop and antiban makes for a well rounded script. Encoded is very active, and does a great job at handling any issues quickly. The fact that it's free makes it all that much better!
