ErickHo's Ex Tutorial Island script for Oldschool Runescape has been around since 2014 and been used by thousands of users. ExTutorial works with either preregistered accounts, or has an option to create them for you. It's an excellent script to get your Runescape bot accounts through the OSRS tutorial island quickly.

### Using Ex Tutorial's Account Creation Feature
**Note: Account creation is currently down until a patch is released**

In order to use account creation, you'll first need a [2captcha](https://2captcha.com?from=2071477) account. 2captcha is a service that solves captchas for you, like the "I'm not a Robot" box on the Runescape account creation page. You can sign up for 2captcha using my affiliate link [here](https://2captcha.com?from=2071477). Luckily, it's cheap, and costs only ~$1.30 per 1,000 captcha solves.

#### 1. Start Ex Tutorial Island
Follow step 2 from above, but this time, don't select an account.

#### 2. Enter your Script Arguments
Adjust the script settings to your liking.

**Example script arguments:**

`
accountCreation:true-domainName:hotmail.com-password:chickenrice123-accountsToMake:30-minAccountCreationDelay﻿:1-maxAccountCreationDelay:3-twocaptchakey:12312dasdasdasdasd222
`

Here's an explanation of each setting:

* **accountCreation:** Leave as **true**
* **domainName:** What email domain to use, this can be real or made up
* **password:** Password to set for the Runescape account
* **accountsToMake:** How many accounts to create & run through tutorial island
* **min/maxAccountCreationDelay﻿:** mix/max minutes to wait between creating accounts
* **twocaptchakey:** Your 2captcha API Key. This can be found after logging into your [2captcha](https://2captcha.com?from=2071477) account.

After you've edited the script arguments to your liking, paste them into the text box on the TRiBot script manager (see above image), and click 'Start'.

Ex Tutorial Island is extremely simple to use, and does its job well! While we've had a great time using the account creation feature in the past, at the time of testing it was broken.

The small amount of settings makes for quick and easy usage, but we'd also love to see more customization options for those who want more control over the process.
