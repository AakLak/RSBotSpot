Proxies are considered a must have by most botting enthusiasts. Using proxies allows you to hide your IP address, and split your bots over multiple networks.

Botters who use proxies report a decreased risk of chain bans when gold-farming. In this guide, I'll cover everything you'll need to start incorporating proxies into your botting routine.

## **So, what's a proxy?**

You can think of a proxy server as a remote computer with it’s own internet connection. When you use a proxy, you route your internet activity through the proxy's connection, rather than your own.

## **How does it work?**

Whenever you visit a website, you expose something called your IP address. An IP address is a unique number used to identify your internet connection. You can think of this like caller ID for telephones: whenever you “call” a website, they see the IP address you called from. When you use a proxy, instead of seeing your home's IP address, the website will see the proxy's IP address.

## **How does a proxy help with botting?**

Runescape keeps track of your IP address each time you log in. Whenever they catch a bot, they check for other bots on the same IP address, and ban them too. That means if you're running a botfarm from a single IP address, you risk getting your entire farm banned simultaneously!

By using proxies, you're able to split your bots over multiple IP addresses. This way Jagex wont be able to link your accounts together and do a chain ban.

## **What should I look for in a proxy?**

When picking a proxy for Runesacpe botting, you should make sure you're getting a private SOCKS proxy. If that sounds confusing, don't worry, we'll break it down.

*   **HTTP vs SOCKS:** All you need to know is that Runescape bots use SOCKS proxies so that's the type you should pick.

*   **Free vs Private:** If you see any free or shared proxies, stay away! The uptime of these proxies is not suitable for botting, and you risk getting one used by other botters or malicious users. With a private proxy, you get exclusive access to the connection.

## **Where do I get proxies?**

Some of our favorite Runescape proxy providers are listed below. Virmach, Proxy Fish, and Your Private Proxy are all excellent sources for SOCKS proxies. They have great connectivity, offer good support, and allow you to swap your proxies once per month. If you're ready to get proxies and expand your farm, look no further!
