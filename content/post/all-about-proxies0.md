Proxies are considered a must have by most gold-farmers. They allow you to mask your IP address, and split your bots over multiple networks. Proxy usage is believed to reduce the risk of chainbans, and losing your entire gold-farm at once.  This guide will cover everything you need to know about proxies for Runescape botting.

## **Why do I need a proxy when botting?**
Whenever you visit a website, you expose something called your IP address. An IP address is a unique number used to identify your internet connection. You can think of this like caller ID for telephones: whenever you “call” a website, they see the IP address you called from.

Common reasons to utilize proxies when botting:
* **Reduce Suspicion:** Botting multiple accounts on the same IP, may look suspicious to Jagex.
* **Reduce Risk:** If one of your accounts happens to get banned, the others may also be at risk, since they are botting on the same IP.
* **Keep your IP clean:** It's good to keep your home IP clean for your main, mule, or legit accounts.

Using a proxy when botting Runescape helps avoid these common issues.

## **So, what's a proxy?**
You can think of a proxy server as a remote computer with it’s own internet connection. When you use a proxy, you route your internet activity through the proxy's connection, rather than your own. This way, Runescape will see your proxy IP address, and not your home IP address.

## **What should I look for in a proxy?**
When picking a proxy for Runesacpe botting, you should make sure you're getting a private SOCKS proxy. If that sounds confusing, don't worry, we'll break it down.

*   **HTTP vs SOCKS:** These are the two different protocols proxies use. All you need to know is that Runescape bots use SOCKS proxies, so that's the type you should pick. HTTP proxies will not work with Runescape bots.

*   **Free vs Shared vs Private:** If you see any free proxies, stay away! The uptime & security of these proxies is not suitable for botting. Shared proxies are okay, but you risk getting a proxy used by another botter. Private proxies are best, since you get exclusive access to the connection.

## **How many proxies do I need?**
The answer to this question is entirely up to you! The *ideal* split would be 1 proxy per 1 bot account, but this can get costly. Most gold-farmers run 2-3 account per proxy for a good cost/risk ratio.

**Example:** If I had a gold-farm of 10 accounts, I'd split them over three proxies.<br>
Two proxies would have 3 accounts on each, and the third proxy would have 4 accounts on it.

## **IMPORTANT: Proper Proxy Usage**
It's **very important** that you use a proxy from account creation to account death. This means your account must be registered on the proxy & use the **same** proxy **every** time it logs in. Do anything else, and you're not utilizing your proxy properly.
