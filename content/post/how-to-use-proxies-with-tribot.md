This guide will cover how to run your bots through proxies on TRiBot. Running your bot through a proxy can help mitigate risk by **avoiding chain bans and protecting your bot-farm**.<!--more-->

Before getting started, we *highly* recommend checking out our [All About Proxies for Runescape Botting]({{< relref "all-about-proxies-for-runescape-botting.md" >}}) guide. It covers everything you need to know about proxies, how they help you avoid chain bans, and trusted sources to buy your proxies from.

They all offer great connectivity, support, and have worked well in our botting tests.

## Some Extra Information
