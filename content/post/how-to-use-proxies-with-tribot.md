Before getting started, you should check out our [All About Proxies for Runescape Botting]({{< relref "all-about-proxies-for-runescape-botting.md" >}}) guide. It covers everything you need to know about proxies, how they help you avoid chain bans, and trusted sources to buy your proxies from.

## 1. Load TRiBot
Open TRiBot and click the Proxy button.

## That’s it!

## Some Extra Info

*   If it's your first time using a particular proxy, you may get a firewall prompt like below. If you do, just select "Always Allow" and hit OK. TRiBot has built in security, so **it's safe to "Always Allow" any connection**.
