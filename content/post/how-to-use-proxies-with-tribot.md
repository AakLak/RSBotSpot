This guide will cover how to run your bots through proxies on TRiBot. Running your bot through a proxy can help mitigate risk by **avoiding chain bans and protecting your bot-farm**.<!--more-->

Before getting started, we *highly* recommend checking out our [All About Proxies for Runescape Botting]({{< relref "all-about-proxies-for-runescape-botting.md" >}}) guide. It covers everything you need to know about proxies, how they help you avoid chain bans, and trusted sources to buy your proxies from.
