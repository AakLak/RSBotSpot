This guide will cover how to properly create & register your Runescape account though a proxy. Most experienced botters know about [the benefits of proxies for Runescape botting](/post/all-about-proxies-for-runescape-botting/), and how they **help avoid chain bans**. However, an often overlooked step by new botters is making sure to create their accounts through proxies.

## **Why This is Important**
If you only use proxies through your bot client, but not for account registration on the website, **all of your accounts could still be linked to your home IP address**. An important rule to remember is to **use proxies from account registration to ban**.

## **How to Confirm You're on a Proxy**
Simply [Google: What's my ip](https://www.google.com/search?q=whats+my+ip) to check your IP address. Google should display your proxy IP address, and not your home IP address.<br>
*To check your home IP, you can [Google: What's my ip](https://www.google.com/search?q=whats+my+ip) on a regular browser without a proxy applied.*
