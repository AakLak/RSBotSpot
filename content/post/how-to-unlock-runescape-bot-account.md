If you've tried your hand at goldfarming, you've probably experienced getting some of your accounts getting locked shorty after tutorial island.

After seeing this, many people assume the account is banned or useless, and continue creating more accounts. But that's not the case! This guide will cover how to get your Runescape bot account unlocked (not unbanned) and continue botting.

Account locks are a common occurrence for people who use [proxies for Runescape botting](/post/all-about-proxies-for-runescape-botting/). In my experience, this does not mean the proxy is flagged, and I'm able to bot successfully after recovery.

## **How to Unlock your Runescape Botting Account** ##
### **1. Log into the Locked Account** ###
Load up Runescape and attempt to log into the account. Then click the "Forgotten your password?" link, and follow the prompts.

I highly recommend using the same IP you created the account on for this step. Check out our [how to register your runescape account through a proxy guide](/post/how-to-create-and-register-runescape-bot-through-proxy/) for info on that.

*Tip: To find out your Internet Service Provider use a tool like [whatsmyip](https://www.whatismyip.com/ip-address-lookup/).*
### **3. Visit Account Recovery Link** ###
Visit the account recovery link in your email from Runescape, and set a new password.

*Recovery email is not instant. Typically comes well within 24 hours*

## **That's it, you're done!** ##
Your account is now unlocked and good to go, Happy Botting!
