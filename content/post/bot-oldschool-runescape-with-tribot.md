With VIP, you can run unlimited instances of all VIP scripts!

  <p class="caption-text">TRiBot Woodcutting Script Search</p>
</div>

Click the **info button** to see more.

When selecting a script to use, there are a few things you can do to ensure its quality:

* **Check last update date:** An old date doesn't always mean a script is broken. But if it hasn't been updated in over a year, it's *typically* outdated.
* **Read the 1st thread post:** From the script info page, click **View Thread**. Here you can read details about the script's features and usage.
* **Read last few thread pages:** Read posts to get a good idea of how users feel about the script, how active the developer is, and if there are any outstanding issues.

If all of these points check out, you've found a solid script!

Click **Activate** to add it to your TRiBot script collection.

## Launch Runescape
Open TRiBot, and click the **New Client** button to launch runescape.

Log into the Runescape account you want to bot.

## Run A Script
Once Runescape has loaded, click the **Start Script** button at the top right.

Select your script, and click start.

Hover to see it happen:
