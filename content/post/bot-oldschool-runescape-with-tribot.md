The <a href="https://tribot.org/repository/user_panel/transfer_credits/" target="_blank">TRiBot repository</a> is where you manage your scripts and subscriptions. It works using a credit system.

TRiBot credits cost $1 per credit, and are used to buy VIP subscriptions and scripts. You can <a href="https://tribot.org/repository/user_panel/purchase_credits/" target="_blank">purchase TRiBot credits</a> with a verified PayPal account or credit card.

You can also purchase credits with Runescape gold or cryptocurrency. YoHoGold, our sister site, is a great place to <a href="https://www.yohogold.com/buy-tribot-credits" target="_blank">buy TRiBot credits</a>.

## How to Select a TRiBot Script
Start by searching the <a href="https://tribot.org/repository" target="_blank">TRiBot Repository</a> and filtering for the type of script you want. Filter by category and pick 'Free' (meaning free for VIP users) as price. Here's my search for a woodcutting script:

  <p class="caption-text">TRiBot Woodcutting Script Search</p>
</div>

Click the **info button** to see more.

When selecting a script to use, there are a few things you can check to ensure its quality:

* **Check last update date:** An old date doesn't necessarily mean the script is broken. But if it hasn't been updated in over a year, it's *typically* outdated.
* **Read the 1st thread post:** From the script info page, click **View Thread**. Here you can read details about the script's features and usage.
* **Read last few thread pages:** Read posts to get a good idea of: how users feel about the script, how active the developer is, and if there are any outstanding issues.

If all of these points check out, you've found a solid script!

Click **Activate** to add it to your TRiBot script collection.

## Launch Runescape
Open TRiBot, and click the **New Client** button to launch runescape.

Log into the Runescape account you want to bot.

## Run A Script
Once Runescape has loaded, click the **Start Script** button at the top right.

Select your script, and click start.
