## About Premium TRiBot Scripts
Premium scripts are high quality scripts created by ranked TRiBot Premium Scripters. They can be purchased in addition to VIP subscription.

Scripters must pass a rigorous application process to gain the Premium Scripter rank, and they are held to a high standard of quality and support.

## Selecting a Good Premium Script Script
Open the <a href="https://tribot.org/repository" target="_blank">TRiBot Repository</a> filter by category, and pick 'Free' (meaning free for VIP users) as price.

Click the **info button** to see more.

When selecting a script, there are a few key things you check to ensure its quality:

* **Use the free trial:** Most premium scripts come with a free trial period. Learn how to activate this in the next section.
* **Read the first thread post:** From the script info page, click **View Thread**. Here you can read details about the script's features.
* **Read last few thread pages:** Read posts to get a good idea of how users feel about the script, how active the developer is, and if there are any outstanding issues.Make sure the dates are recent.
* **Check last update date:** An old date doesn't always mean a script is broken. But if it hasn't been updated in over a year, it's *typically* outdated.

If all of these points check out, you've found a solid script!

## Premium Script Pricing: Free Trials & Auths
Most premium scripts offer a free trial which allows you to test before purchase. After <a href="https://tribot.org/repository/" target="_blank">searching for a script</a>, click Info, and then Activate under Trial.
