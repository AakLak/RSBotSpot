TRiBot's [Looking Glass feature](https://tribot.org/forums/topic/48785-what-is-looking-glass/?tab=comments#comment-577526) allows you to bot through the official Runescape client by hooking onto and controlling it. Looking glass also supports [proxies for botting](/post/all-about-proxies-for-runescape-botting/) & other clients like OSBuddy.

While there's no evidence that TRiBot is detectable, this feature was released as a form of antiban for users worried about the potential detectability of botting clients. Botters seem to be torn 50/50 about the effectiveness of Looking Glass on bans, but it never hurts to have some extra protection. This guide will cover how to use TRiBot Looking Glass to bot through the official Runescape client!

### **1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK)** ###
Download and install JDK [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
I will be using 32 bit JDK 8u151.

*At the time of writing, only Java 8 is supported.*

### **2. Load Runescape & TRiBot** ###
Load Runescape up to the login screen, and TRiBot up to the client select screen.

### **3. Start Looking Glass** ###
On TRiBot, click the "New Client (Looking Glass)" button.

### **4.(Optional) Set a Proxy** ###
If you're [using a proxy for runescape botting](/post/all-about-proxies-for-runescape-botting/), now's the time to apply it.
To do this: right click the client's tab on TRiBot, and select "Set Proxy".
